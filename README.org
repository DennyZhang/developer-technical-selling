* Do a better technical selling as a developer
Github Repo: https://github.com/DennyZhang/developer-technical-selling
** Principle
*** Show, donâ€™t tell.
*** Build trust and frienship first, before starting to sell
*** Don't sell products I personaly have no faith
- Advertising is only evil when it advertises evil things
** Routine tasks
** Different forms of technical selling
*** Each blog post is a product: journalism + advertising
