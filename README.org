--------------------------------------------------------
** Principle
*** Don't sell products I personaly have no faith
- Advertising is only evil when it advertises evil things
*** Build trust and frienship first, before trying to sell
*** Show, don’t tell.
*** Remarkability is the key. Nobody can or should sell garbage
** Lessons learned
*** Don’t forget the silent majority
*** The most powerful marketing is personal recommendation. And it usually happen offline
*** Be very careful with self-promotion activities
Don't post your links everywhere. **Stop it now!**

It won't work. And it will hurt your image. Make your products looks crappy.
** Concepts
*** Social Currency
- Early adopters have social currency
- We share things that make us look good
*** Public Visibility
- If something is built to show, it's built to grow.
- Social proof
- Social influence was stronger when behavior was more observable
- Public visibility boosts word of mouth
- If you want to get people not to do something, don't tell them that lots of their peers are doing it.
- If something is built to show, it's built to grow
*** Practical values
- Passing along useful things also strengthens social bonds.
- Whether it seems like a fair price or not depends on your expectations
*** Trigger
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Market research often focuses on consumer's immediate reaction to an advertising message or campaign. That might be valuable in situations where the consumer is immediately offered a chance to buy the product. But in most cases, people hear an ad one day and then go to the store days or weeks later. If they're not triggered to think about it, how will they remember that ad when they're at the store?
#+END_EXAMPLE

- So by linking Kit Kat to coffee, Colleen created a frequent trigger to remind people of the brand.
- Mars bars and Mars the planet are already naturally connected
- French music is a natural trigger for French wine
- The last day of the workweek is a natural trigger for Rebecca Black's song "Friday"
- Holidays are made for Michelob. is ineffective to. Weekends are made for Michelob.
- Triggers are the foundation of word of mouth and contagiousness.
- Social currency gets people talking. But triggers keep them talking.
- Top of mind means tip of tongue
** Routine Tasks
*** Collect surprising facts
- Sample: average person spends two weeks over his/her lifetime waiting for traffic lights to change
** Different Products To Sell
*** Each blog post is a product: journalism + advertising
*** Product review/Sponsored posts
*** Affiliate marketing: recommend good products and get commissions.
*** Build your own information products
