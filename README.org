* Do a better technical selling as a developer
Github Repo: https://github.com/DennyZhang/developer-technical-selling
** Principle
*** Don't sell products I personaly have no faith
- Advertising is only evil when it advertises evil things
*** Build trust and frienship first, before trying to sell
*** Show, donâ€™t tell.
** Lesson learned
*** Be very careful with self-promotion activities
Don't post your links everywhere. **Stop it now!**

It won't work. And it will hurt your image. Make your products looks crappy.
** Routine tasks
** Different forms of technical selling
*** Each blog post is a product: journalism + advertising
