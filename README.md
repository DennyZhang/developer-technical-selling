-   Early adopters have social currency
-   We share things that make us look good

### Public Visibility<a id="sec-1-2-2" name="sec-1-2-2">[]</a>

-   If something is built to show, it's built to grow.
-   Social proof
-   Social influence was stronger when behavior was more observable
-   Public visibility boosts word of mouth
-   If you want to get people not to do something, don't tell them that lots of their peers are doing it.
-   If something is built to show, it's built to grow

### Practical values<a id="sec-1-2-3" name="sec-1-2-3">[]</a>

-   Passing along useful things also strengthens social bonds.
-   Whether it seems like a fair price or not depends on your expectations

-   French music is a natural trigger for French wine
-   The last day of the workweek is a natural trigger for Rebecca Black's song "Friday"
-   Holidays are made for Michelob. is ineffective to. Weekends are made for Michelob.
-   Triggers are the foundation of word of mouth and contagiousness.
-   Social currency gets people talking. But triggers keep them talking.
-   Top of mind means tip of tongue

## Lesson learned<a id="sec-1-3" name="sec-1-3">[]</a>

Don't post your links everywhere. ****Stop it now!****  

It won't work. And it will hurt your image. Make your products looks crappy.
